# Informatica programmeren-4 assignment Share a Meal server

![Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/AnikaWante/programmeren-4-shareameal/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This project is made for the 'programmeren 4' course for Avans Hogeschool. It is an API that allows CRUD functionality for users and meals. You can login as a user, and add, delete and update your own meals. This API is based on the API we used in 'programmeren 3' where we made a share-a-meal android application, where you could use CRUD functionality on users and meals. This API is accessable by using the URL "https://avans-sam-api.herokuapp.com/". U can add api/user or api/meal to access the user and meal endpoints. This project uses a MySQL database deployed on Heroku. At the very top of this file you can see the status of the deployment.
